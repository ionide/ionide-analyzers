# CopyAndUpdateRecordChangesAllFieldsAnalyzer

## Problem

See [fsharp/fslang-suggestions#603](https://github.com/fsharp/fslang-suggestions/issues/603), when you have a record update expression that overrides all fields, it is advised to construct a new instance instead. 

```fsharp
type Point = 
    {
        X: int
        Y: int
    }

let zero = { X = 0; Y = 0;
// Triggers analyzer
let moved = { zero with X = 1; Y = 2 }
```

## Fix

Remove the `expr with` part:

```fsharp
let moved = { X = 1; Y = 2 }
```
