# EmptyStringAnalyzer

## Problem

Testing symbolically for an empty string is not the most efficient way.  
Using the `String.Length` property or the `String.IsNullOrEmpty` method is the preferred way.  
This is a port of the Roslyn analyzer [ca1820](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/quality-rules/ca1820)

```fsharp
let s = "foo"
let b = s = "" // Triggers analyzer 
```

## Fix

Use the `Length` property if you know the reference is not null or the `String.IsNullOrEmpty` method otherwise.

```fsharp
let s = "foo"
let b = s.Length = 0
```

## Ignore Comment

You can ignore this analyzer on a line by adding the following comment:

```fsharp
let s = "foo"
// IGNORE: IONIDE-004
let b = s.Length = 0
```
