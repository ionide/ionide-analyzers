# IgnoreFunctionAnalyzer

## Problem

See [dotnet/fsharp#15880](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/15880), it can be confusing when a function is ignored when the user expects it to be evaluated.

```fsharp
let f g () = g + 1
let a = f 1
// `a` was not evaluated and is ignored as function
// instead of the result being ignored.  
ignore a
```

## Fix

Ensure the function is being executed:

```fsharp
ignore (a())
```

## Ignore Comment

You can ignore this analyzer on a line by adding the following comment:

```fsharp
let f g () = g + 1
let a = f 1
// IGNORE: IONIDE-002
ignore a
```
